This Usage Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), server logs may include information regarding your browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the website from which you came (referrer URL), the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data. The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association with any other of your data. Our legitimate interest in this data lies in the improvement, stability, functionality, and security of our website.

Tracking and Cookies Data
We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track the activity on our Service and we hold certain information. Cookies are files with a small amount of data which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your device. Other tracking technologies are also used such as beacons, tags, and scripts to collect and track information and to improve and analyze our Service. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Service.

Examples of Cookies we use:

Session Cookies: These cookies process certain specific information about you, such as your browser, location data, or IP address. This processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure, allowing us, for example, to display our website in different languages or to offer a shopping cart function. These cookies are used to collect data to initiate or process contractual relationships. If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our legitimate interest lies in improving the functionality of our website. When you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.

Third-party Cookies: If necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with whom we cooperate for the purpose of advertising, analyzing, or improving the feature of our website. More details on these are below.

Disabling Cookies: You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to delete cookies that have already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary, depending on the browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your browser or contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot prevent so-called flash cookies from being set. Instead, you will need to change the setting of your Flash player. The steps and measures required for this also depend on the Flash player you are using. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your Flash player or contact its maker for support.

If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, not all of the functions on our site may be fully usable.

Other Collected Data, Why and How it is shared and protected
Personal data is not just created by a user’s interactions with our site. Personal data is also generated from technical processes such as contact forms, comments, cookies, analytics, and third party embeds. By default WordPress does not collect any personal data about visitors, and only collects the data shown on the User Profile screen from registered users. However some of our plugins do collect personal data:

Comments
When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

We may also offer you the opportunity to post questions, answers, opinions, and ratings on our website, hereinafter referred to jointly as “posts”. If you make use of this opportunity, we will process and publish your post, the date and time you submitted it, and any pseudonym you may have used. You may revoke your prior consent: all you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent. In addition, we will also process your IP address and email address. The IP address is processed because we might have a legitimate interest in taking or supporting further action if your post infringes the rights of third parties and/or is otherwise unlawful. In this case, the legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in any legal defense we may have to mount.

If you make posts on our website, we also offer you the opportunity to subscribe to any subsequent follow-up comments made by third parties. In order to be able to inform you about these follow-up comments, we will need to process your email address. You may revoke your prior consent: all you have to do is inform us you are revoking your consent or click the unsubscribe link contained in each email.

Media
If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.

Contact forms
If you contact the Service via email or the contact form, the data you provide will be used for the purpose of processing your request. We must have this data in order to process and answer your inquiry; otherwise we will not be able to answer it in full or at all. We keep contact form submissions for a certain period for customer service purposes, but we do not use the information submitted through them for marketing purposes. Your data will be deleted once we have fully answered your inquiry and there is no further legal obligation to store your data, such as if an order or contract resulted therefrom.

Newsletter
If you register for our free newsletter, the data requested from you for this purpose (i.e. your email address and the optional data) will be sent to us. We also store the IP address of your computers and the date and time of your registration. During the registration process, we will obtain your consent to receive this newsletter and the type of content it will offer, with reference made to this privacy policy. The data collected will be used exclusively to send the newsletter and will not be passed on to third parties. You may revoke your prior consent to receive this newsletter. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent or click on the unsubscribe link contained in each newsletter. The service used for delivery of email newsletters is Mailchimp and you can read MailChimp’s Privacy Policy here.

Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics on our website. This is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 (hereinafter: Google). Google guarantees that it will follow the EU’s Data Protection Regulations when processing data in the United States.

The Google Analytics service is used to analyze how our website is used. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our site. Usage and user-related information, such as IP address, place, time, or frequency of your visits to our website will be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and stored there. However, we use Google Analytics with the so-called anonymization function, whereby Google truncates the IP address within the EU or the EEA before it is transmitted to the US.

The data collected in the way is in turn used by Google to provide us with an evaluation of visits to our website and what visitors do once there. This data can also be used to provide other services related to the use of our website and of the internet in general.

Google states that it will not connect your IP address to other data. In addition, Google provides further information with regard to its data protection practices at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners, including options you can exercise to prevent such use of your data. In addition, Google offers an opt-out add-on at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en in addition with further information. This add-on can be installed on the most popular browsers and offers you further control over the data that Google collects when you visit our website. The add-on informs Google Analytics’ JavaScript (ga.js) that no information about the website visit should be transmitted to Google Analytics. However, this does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analytics services we may use as detailed herein.

Google’s use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our Service and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting Ads Settings or by visiting www.aboutads.info

If you do not agree to this processing, you have the option of preventing the installation of cookies by making the appropriate settings in your browser. Further details can be found in the section about cookies above.

Embedded content from other websites
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website. These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website. I do not have any control over those other websites. I cannot accept any liability for this third-party content. A permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation. As soon as we become aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.

Advertising and Affiliate Partners
Some of our advertising partners and/or affiliate programs may use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over the cookies that are used by third-party advertisers and affiliates.

Some of the affiliate or referral programs we use operate by use of a referral link. When a link is clicked, any purchases made by a visitor can be tracked to this Service to track any sales for purposes of commissions for the referral. You can find referral links throughout this Service, for which I can receive compensation if you make a purchase of a product or service through the links on this page. This will at all times be stated in the page or post where affiliate links occur, and you have no obligation to use the links if you intend to make the purchase of said product or service.

Google’s use of advertising cookies helps it and its partners show ads based on your visit to this website and other sites on the internet. You can opt-out of personalized adverts. Google provides further information with regard to its data protection practices at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners, including options you can exercise to prevent such use of your data. In addition, Google offers an opt-out add-on at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en in addition with further information.
